<h1>Needs Statement</h1>

    <p>The focus of this proposal is to expand on our existing Parent Professional Development Internship Program,
        providing a comprehensive job training program for low-income diverse parents from ages 20-43.
        The expected starting date is in May of 2025.
        Through this program, we will increase the job prospects for the participants and increase their economic trajectory.
        The presence of the voices of younger generations will help us at PICA better understand the needs of multi-generational families and better represent the community our organization serves.
        Diversity needs to be seen within the early childhood education sector,
        and we at PICA have already been making strides to achieve this goal.</p>

    <p> The following Needs Statement will highlight the need for more young, diverse, and qualified early childhood educators in Hennepin County, MN.
        Census and survey data show that Minneapolis is a high-risk population with higher rates of poverty and larger minority communities compared to Minnesota as a whole.
        The growing shortage of qualified early childhood educators creates economic problems as well as complications for individual low-income families.</p>

    <p>The strategic plan will outline the detailed steps needed to expand our Parent Professional Development Internship Program.
        Our program will span 2 years and 4 months, divided into 4 measurable phases.
        An expanded timeline and steps will be provided in the plan.</p>

    <p>Finally, the budget will justify the costs of this program.
        We are requesting $208,000 from the Department of Employment and Economic Development.
        Funding is requested for training materials as well as proper compensation for all staff involved in training.</p>


<h2>Why Early Childhood Education Job Training and CDA Certification?</h2>

    <p>The framework has been built within the Needs Statement to establish the need for culturally and linguistically diverse early childhood educators.
        Parents, caregivers, and educators alike recognize a need for more quality and affordable early childhood care providers.
        By providing early childhood education training to interested young and diverse parents,
        it is our hope at PICA to grow the early childhood education workforce.
        Hands-on training in our PICA Head Start education centers
        would allow participants to learn to provide quality childcare to diverse children while still maintaining their current paying jobs.</p>

    <p>The outcome of the program is that 25 low-income diverse parents from ages 20-43 will receive their Child Development Associate (CDA) certification.
        The CDA is nationally recognized and established the credibility of early childhood educators.
        By obtaining a CDA certification, parent participants' job prospects in early childhood development care and education will greatly increase.
        Incentivizing this training program will result in an increase in CDA-certified early childhood educators and improve the economic trajectory of the families involved.
        Encouraging involvement in the early childhood education sector is just the beginning of the work that needs to be done.</p>

    <p>The high density of Hennepin County makes it an effective place to begin to implement smart and efficient solutions to address childcare disparities.
        At-risk members of the community face a multitude of consequences as a result of situations that are often out of their control.
        Being an at-risk community means there is room for economic growth through improving the well-being of families and children in the region.
        On behalf of PICA, we look forward to a continued partnership with the DEED of Minnesota.</p>

<h2>Summary of Needs Statement</h2>

    <p>Our organization has taken the steps to create positive change in the early childhood education sector.
        PICA is currently the number one trainer of teachers of color in Minnesota.
        Hennepin Country is identified as a high-risk community by U.S. Census data.
        Diversity within early childhood educators does not reflect the diversity of the children they provide care for.
        To increase the economic trajectory of families within this high-risk community, 
        we at PICA will continue to ensure that unique and underrepresented voices are being heard and lifted.
        With the financial support of the DEED of Minnesota,
        we will expand our established internship program to provide incentivized early childhood job training
        at little or no cost to the parents involved.</p>
