<h2>To: Minnesota Department of Education and Economic Development (DEED)</h2>
<p>Authored by Laura Turner, University of Minnesota. Partnered with Parents In Community Action (PICA) of Minneapolis, Minnesota</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

    <p>One problem that plagues the early childhood education sector is the lack of educator diversity in Minnesota.
    92% of Minnesota's early childhood educators identify as white-alone,
    along with 98% of the educators being comprised of women with an average age of 44 years old.
    Hennepin County's highly diverse and growing population needs to be reflected in the educators who serve these children.</p>

    <p>We at Parents in Community Action (PICA) serve the community of Hennepin County,
    which is identified as a high-risk community by U.S. Census Bureau data.
    At-risk members of the community face a multitude of consequences as a result of situations that are often out of their control.
    Being an at-risk community means there is room for economic growth through improving the well-being of families and children in the region.
    We aim to achieve this by following the format of activity, object, and goal.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To increase the presence of diverse and young voices in the early childhood development sector.</li>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> 25 PICA parents aged 20-43 years will receive their CDA certification.</li>
        <li><strong>Activity:</strong> Childcare development training and internship program to obtain CDA certification.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Through this job training program for low-income diverse parents from ages 20-43,
    we will increase the number of CDA-certified early childhood development educators.
    This 4-phase program will increase the job prospects for the participants and increase their economic trajectory.
    The program has an expected start date of May 2025.
    It is the hope that PICA will retain the participants as full-time employees,
    further increasing the quality of our programs.
    The presence of the voices of younger generations will help us educators and care providers to better understand the needs of multi-generational families,
    as well as better represent the community our organization serves.</p>

    <p>Early Childhood educators are essential in Minnesota as a whole,
    beyond Head Start programs like ours at PICA.
    We sincerely hope that this program can act as a model for other organizations within the state.
    By increasing the amount of trained early childhood educators,
    the lives of both children and parents in Minnesota will be greatly improved.</p>
