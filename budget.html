<h1>Budget</h1>

    <p>This 4-phase training program will increase the job prospects for the participants and increase their economic trajectory.
        It is the hope that participants will continue at PICA as full-time employees,
        further increasing our overall assets for further expansion and programs.
        Program eligibility requirements include that parent participant must have an income that matches Head Start program requirements.
        The total dollar amount requested is approximately $208,000.
        The total cost of $208,000 is estimated based on 2023 and 2024 data,
        projecting the expected costs for May 2025 when the program is expected to start.
        This requested fund will cover personnel and curriculum costs, application and evaluation fees,
        and childcare coverage for participants. </p>

<h2>Budget Narrative</h2>

    <p>This narrative will provide rationale and expected utilization for each portion of the budget.</p>

<h3>Personnel</h3>

    <p>The 15 training staff will make a total of 64,000 a year (54,000 base adding 8,000 in training compensation).
        Training compensation will be distributed year-round as an hourly rate increase.
        This is based on data from the Minnesota Child Care Cost Modeling Report 2023.</p>

<h3>Curriculum</h3>

    <p>The curriculum used for participant training must be purchased through the Council for Professional Recognition.
        Each participant will require an individual workbook bundle available through the online store.
        <calc>160/bundle x 25 participants = 4,000</calc></p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

    <p>Application fees are required for the application to be processed.
        Scholarships through Child Care Aware Minnesota will cover 300 of the 425 total application costs per participant.
	    <calc>425 x 25 participants = 10,625</calc></p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

    <p>Evaluation will be conducted by members of the Council for Professional Recognition.
        Compensation will be necessary for travel expenses and meals for these members.
        Estimates will be based on Federal per diem rates for Minneapolis.
	    <calc>148/night x 7 days = 1,036, 92/day x 7 days = 644</calc>

</p>

<h3>Childcare Coverage</h3>

    <p>Childcare will be provided to the children of participating parents throughout the project duration.
        Eligibility in PICA Head Start is required to participate in the project.
        As Head Start programs are funded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
        this will come at no additional cost to the budget.
        This includes payments for transportation, provided meals, building costs, and staff wages.</p>

<h2>Summary of Budget</h2>
    
    <p>Much of the project costs will be provided through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
        but $208,000 is requested from the DEED of Minnesota.
        The project coordinator is to be aware of relevant scholarships surrounding the certification process\
        and to utilize those scholarships to the fullest extent.
        The total cost of $208,000 is estimated based on data from 2023 and 2024,
        projecting the expected costs for 2025 through 2027.
        Program spending is appropriate in proportion to the annual revenue and expenses of the PICA Head Start program.</p>
