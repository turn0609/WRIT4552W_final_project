# Final Project Commentary

For my final project, I chose to reformat a final proposal I completed for a grant writing class in HTML. 
I mainly decided to reformat the paper into HTML, as it was something that I wanted more practice with.
I will acknowledge that the format in which I originally completed the proposal would be the most effective
in a digital document or a printed booklet (the original format). 
However, I felt as though practicing HTML would be a more efficient (and fun) use of my time, as my original
proposal is already print-ready.

Since the project requirement for HTML required 5 specific pages,
I chose to make each distinct section of the proposal into its own page. 
I decided to make the navigation bar at the top,
so that the reader can easily click through each section.
The executive summary became the landing page,
since that would be the first item that any proposal reviewer would be reading.

In general, for this project, I did my best to combine a modern web look with accessible content.
The hero image adds some visual interest to the page,
while the title is still readable over the image with a low opacity backdrop.
The navigation bar maintains the underlined style of the link,
and I provided visual clues that the link can be clicked.

The only tradeoff I had to make for the document was the loss of clear page numbers and a table of contents.
However, the HTML formatting did allow me to essentially create a product that doesn't need page numbers.
The finished product, with the navigation bar, allows readers to clearly see where they are and where they can go.
I intended for the use of big, bold section headings to clearly state which content is displayed on the page.
There is no need for a table of contents when the webpage itself is organized into pages
that the reader can easily move through.

One of the main struggles I ran into while reformatting the proposal was keeping the content accessible.
Readability was something that I had to purposely consider.
In their plain form, HTML paragraphs span the entire width of the page, with a minimal line height.
I made sure to:
* Increase text size
* Increase line height within paragraphs
* Added extra margins on either side of the text
to increase readability.

I did my best to follow general web practices,
such as making the text span shorter than the total length of the browser,
allowing readers to scan the text more quickly.

In general, some of the pros of formatting a project in HTML are:
* High degree of customization
* No limitations on content
* Easy to access for digital audiences

However, some of the cons are:
* Generally slower than using a word processor
* More work to make the project responsive/cross-device
* Not print-ready
* Need to upload the page to an external site like GitHub

Overall, I enjoyed the flexibility that this project allowed.
I was able to get creative with my website design.
I find HTML to be a fun coding language, and being able to
efficiently create content for websites is something that I
expect to do in my future career.
Through the reformatting of the proposal,
I was able to make a website that is both clean and readable.
