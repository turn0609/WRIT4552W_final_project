<h1>Strategic Plan</h1>

    <p>We at PICA pride ourselves on being the number one trainer of teachers of color in Minnesota.
        The "Grow Your Own" concept of staff development that we implement helps staff members represent the families we serve.
        This program aims to increase the number of low-income diverse educators from ages 20-43.
        The project will occur in four phases, spanning two years and four months.
        Each phase and actions within the phase will be explained in detail in the following sections.</p>

<h2>Program Phases</h2>

    <p><strong>Phase 1</strong> of the program will consist of program recruitment
        and working one-on-one with parents to schedule training times for phase 2.
        This stage will begin with the Parent-Child Advocate collecting applications,
        meeting with the project manager, and submitting applications to the Center Committee.
        The training center(s) will then be decided based on the location and availability of program parents.
        Further, training times and cohorts will then be determined.</p>

    <p><strong>Phase 2</strong> consists of participation in the Child Development Training Program.
        This will occur twice a week consisting of 2 hour sessions.
        This format will be continued throughout the project into phase 3.
        Participating parents will be allowed to train hands-on in our PICA classrooms and learn about infant and child development.</p>

    <p><strong>Phase 3</strong> consists of participation in the Parent Professional Development Internship Program.
        Participating parents will receive a combined 120 hours of certified training in our PICA classrooms and programs.
        This training will abide by the Council for Professional Recognition's CDA training guidelines.</p>

    <p><strong>Phase 4</strong> begins once participating parents have received their combined 120 hours of certified training.
        Parents will then request to be evaluated during a visit by a member of the Council for Professional Recognition,
        and upon completion will be able to schedule a time to complete the CDA exam.
        Once certification is acquired, parents will finally meet back and evaluate future steps.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

    <p>Below is a brief overview of the Program timeline.
        The expected timeframe will be from May 2025 to September 2027.
        This timeline is based on typical completion times of CDA training programs.
        Steps will be further elaborated upon in the coming sections.</p>

<h2>Summary of Strategic Plan</h2>

    <p>Our proposed program contains 4 stages: 
        <em>Program recruitment,
        Childhood development training program,
        Parent professional development internship program,
        and Two-part certification by the Council of Professional Recognition</em>. 
        The intended outcome is to increase the job prospects of the participants and increase their economic contributions to society.
        It is the hope that participants will continue as full-time employees within our organization,
        further increasing the quality of our programs.
        The presence of the voices of younger generations will help us to better understand the needs of multi-generational families,
        as well as better represent the community our organization serves.</p>
